# Offline-chat-application
Offline chat application system is a project aims in connecting people and helps them to communicate with ease through LAN (local area network). My project is an example of chat server. As in the beginning of the name offline indicates that the communication (chatting) is made without consuming any mobile data as the other application usually do. This application feature is generally not available in application such as what's app, hike, etc. It requires no application, or update download or installation. Way to chat with your friends through LAN. No internet connection is needed. The only thing which requires is server IP address and you will be able to connect to others members through LAN. It can help you to talk to your friends even you both do not have internet connection.
